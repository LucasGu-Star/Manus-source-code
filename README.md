# Manus-source-code
This project involves obtaining Manus' underlying runtime files through specialized reverse-engineering methods. What we've acquired constitutes the complete source code of the existing Manus system - including core algorithms, framework architecture, and proprietary protocols.

# HOPE
I hope a destined developer will take these source codes and build something greater—a mirror of Manus, an agent even more powerful. Don’t forget about me! Leave a comment on my project—I want to see what you all create!!
